# Breaking the glass ceiling - final project for 'Introduction to human computer interaction' (HCI) course (67298):
Shirley Haimoff and I had designed and programmed a human-computer interaction using Arduino, 3D printing, Rhino and Grasshopper. 
The project combines gesture recognition using an accelerometer and a computer game challenging the player to break the glass ceiling.
